      <b>About the Company</b>
      <br>
      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The company Whale Home Price Calculator (WHPC) was established during the summer of 2015 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A young group of three individuals came together during a summer program with Google called the Computer Science Summer Institute. Towards the end of this three-week intensive summer program, Jeremy, Liz and Erica formed a group to create this page for their final project. With three amazing minds working together, the group was able to create the Arbitrary Card Generator in a span of just four days. They decided to put the page under a company name called Whale Home Price Calculator, which comprises the three of them.
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The name Whale Home Price Calculator (WHPC) was inspired by one of Jeremy's ideas during the brainstorming session. He suggested that the group create a page that calculates the price of a whale home that would be based under Google's Headquarters in Mountain View, California. The said idea, of course, was immediately rejected by the rest of his group. To perhaps make up for hurting Jeremy's feelings, Erica and Liz agreed to name their group WHPC, and thus the most amazing company ever existed was born.
